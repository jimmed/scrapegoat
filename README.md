# scrapegoat

Make a GraphQL API from a website using scrapers

## Motivation

Ever wish that static website had an API? Me too, and now you can build your own.

## Features

- Declarative setup
- Sensible defaults, much configurability

## TODO

- [ ] Declarative scrapers (in progress)
- [ ] GraphQL type generation
- [ ] GraphQL resolver generation
- [ ] Caching (make-fetch-happen?)
- [ ] Apollo-boost example
