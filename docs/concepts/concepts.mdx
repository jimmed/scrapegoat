# Concepts: Overview

Scrapers go through a series of steps to pull data from a website â”€ those generated by Severus Scrape are no different.
These steps typically follow as such:

1. Generate a URL for the page to scrape
2. Fetch the page
3. Parse the page's HTML into a DOM
4. Extract data from the DOM

To achieve this, Severus Scrape uses the following concepts:

<!-- - **Site** - A collection of pages, served from the same domain -->

- [**Pages**](/concepts/page) - A named mapping from a parameterised URL to a scraper (and parser)
- [**Scrapers**](/concepts/scraper) - A function which converts a DOM node into meaningful data
