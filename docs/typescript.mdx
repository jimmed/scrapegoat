# TypeScript Support

scrapegoat is written in TypeScript, and comes bundled with type definitions.
As much as possible, scrapegoat is written to be 100% type safe, as well as providing strong (but flexible) definitions for all types used.

## Typing Pages

You can use type generics to specify both the arguments and return type of a page.

```ts
type Args = { postId: number };
type BlogPost = { title: string; body: string };

export const blogPostPage = page<Args, BlogPost>({
  url: ({ postId }) => `https://mycool.blog/posts/${postId}`,
  scrape: section<BlogPost>("main", {
    title: text("h1"),
    body: text("article")
  })
});
```

In the above example, we call `page` with two type parameters, `Args` and `BlogPost`.
By doing this, we can ensure type safety of the parameters we pass into our scraper, as well as the scraper definitions themselves.

As an added bonus, we get excellent autocomplete support in editors with a good TypeScript integration.

## Typing Scrapers

Due to the power of TypeScript's inference engine, basic scrapers like `text` and `attr` can be used without any additional type annotations.

However, for the slightly more complicated cases of `list`, `section` and `tuple`, you will often need to supply type parameters to the scraper, in order to give the type system enough information to correctly type the scraper function.
All three of these methods accept a single type parameter:

- `section` and `tuple` accept a type parameter representing the whole returned object.
- `list` accepts a type parameter representing an item of the returned array.

```ts
type Args = { postId: number };
type BlogPost = {
  title: string;
  body: string;
  comments: Comment[];
};
type Comment = {
  author: string;
  body: string;
  timestamp: Date;
};

export const blogPostPage = page<Args, BlogPost>({
  url: ({ postId }) => `https://mycool.blog/posts/${postId}`,
  scrape: section<BlogPost>("main", {
    title: text("h1"),
    body: text("article"),
    comments: list<Comment>(
      ".comments",
      tuple<Comment>("div", [
        { author: text() },
        { body: text(), timestamp: attr("time", "timestamp") }
      ])
    )
  })
});
```
